\section*{REVIEWER \#1}

We thank Reviewer \#1 for the thorough and constructive evaluation. All ten comments have been carefully addressed with substantial revisions to the manuscript.

\subsection*{Comment (1): Fair Comparison of Bandgap Width Using Relative Bandwidth}

\begin{reviewerbox}
It is claimed that ``triangular lattices achieve 40\% wider band gaps compared to square configurations and demonstrate superior broadband characteristics''. However, I do not think their band gap width are fairly compared. In this work, the widest band gap for the case of triangular lattice opens in a much higher frequency range ($\sim$145 Hz) than that for the case of square lattice ($\sim$105 Hz), but their band gap width are quantified by absolute bandwidth given by $(f_2-f_1)$. Such a comparison of absolute bandgap width cannot be accepted in this field. For a fair comparison, the authors should use the relative bandgap width $(f_2-f_1)/f_c$, where $f_c=(f_2+f_1)/2$. Or alternatively, they should choose a larger lattice constant for the case of square lattice, so that a widest band gap can be created in a similar frequency range as the case of triangular lattices.
\end{reviewerbox}

\begin{responsebox}
We sincerely thank the reviewer for this critical and constructive observation. The reviewer is absolutely correct that comparing absolute bandgap widths $(f_2-f_1)$ across different frequency ranges is inappropriate for fair performance assessment. We acknowledge this fundamental methodological issue and have completely revised our comparative analysis to employ \textbf{relative bandgap width metrics} as recommended by the metamaterial community.

\textbf{Key issues addressed:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Frequency range discrepancy: Triangular ($\sim$145 Hz) vs. Square ($\sim$105 Hz) optimal ranges
    \item Inappropriate absolute comparison: $(f_2-f_1)$ in Hz units without normalization
    \item Missing center frequency normalization: $f_c = (f_1+f_2)/2$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Solution implemented:} We have adopted the reviewer's recommended \textbf{dual-metric framework} that employs both:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Absolute bandwidth (FBGW):} Provides practical engineering insights for applications with specific frequency targets
    \item \textbf{Relative bandwidth ($\eta_{rel}$):} Enables frequency-independent geometric performance comparison through normalization
\end{enumerate}

This approach addresses both the practical engineering question (``which lattice for my target frequency?'') and the fundamental scientific question (``which geometry is intrinsically superior?'').
\end{responsebox}

\begin{changesbox}
\textbf{Major modifications implemented:}

\textbf{Location 1: Section 3.3 - Introduction (Lines 778)}

\textit{New introductory paragraph:}
\begin{quote}
\textcolor{redtext}{``The comprehensive individual analyses presented in previous subsections enable quantitative performance comparison across all five lattice configurations using two complementary metrics that address distinct design considerations. This dual-metric framework employs: (1) \textbf{absolute bandwidth} (FBGW in [Hz]) providing direct engineering insights for applications with specific frequency targets, and (2) \textbf{relative bandwidth} ($\eta_{rel}$ in [\%]) enabling frequency-independent geometric performance comparison through normalization.''}
\end{quote}

\textbf{Location 2: Section 3.3 - New Subheading and Equation (Lines 812-821)}

\textit{New subheading:} ``\textbf{Relative Bandwidth Analysis for Fair Geometric Comparison}''

\textit{New equation and definition:}
\begin{equation}
\textcolor{redtext}{\eta_{rel} = \frac{f_2 - f_1}{f_c} \times 100\%}
\end{equation}
\textcolor{redtext}{where $f_c = (f_1 + f_2)/2$ is the center frequency of the bandgap, $f_1$ and $f_2$ are the lower and upper bandgap boundaries, and $\eta_{rel}$ represents the normalized bandwidth efficiency. This dimensionless metric removes frequency-dependent scaling effects, enabling direct comparison of intrinsic geometric performance across different operational ranges.}

\textbf{Location 3: Section 3.3 - Comprehensive Relative Bandwidth Table (Lines 825-858)}

\textit{New Table 14: ``Comprehensive relative bandgap width comparison ($\eta_{rel}$) across five lattice configurations''}

Complete frequency-sweep analysis with 15 resonator frequencies (10-150 Hz) $\times$ 5 lattices = 75 normalized data points, revealing:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Triangular:} Peak efficiency 42.51\% at 140 Hz
    \item \textbf{Square:} Peak efficiency 31.40\% at 100 Hz
    \item \textbf{Performance advantage:} 35\% improvement in normalized terms [(42.51-31.40)/31.40 = 35.4\%]
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Location 4: Abstract (Line 82)}

\textit{Corrected performance claim:}\\
Original: ``triangular lattices achieve 40\% wider band gaps''\\
Revised: \textcolor{redtext}{``triangular lattices achieve 35\% superior relative bandwidth compared to square configurations (42.51\% vs 31.40\%)''}

\textbf{Location 5: Conclusions (Line 1135)}

\textit{Updated with normalized metrics:}\\
\textcolor{redtext}{``triangular lattices achieve superior broadband performance with 35\% superior relative bandwidth compared to conventional square configurations (42.51\% vs 31.40\%)''}

\textbf{Location 6: Highlights (Line 30 in highlights.tex)}

\textit{Corrected to reflect normalized comparison:}\\
\textcolor{redtext}{``Triangular lattices achieve 35\% superior relative bandwidth (42.51\% vs 31.40\%)''}

\textbf{Location 7: Section 3.3 - Reorganized Structure (Lines 778-864)}

The section has been pedagogically reorganized with logical flow:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Absolute bandwidth analysis (practical engineering insights)
    \item Transition explaining limitations of absolute comparison
    \item Relative bandwidth definition and equation
    \item Comprehensive normalized analysis (Table 14)
    \item Dual-metric synthesis
\end{enumerate}

This structure naturally motivates the need for normalized comparison, demonstrating that triangular lattice superiority is maintained across the entire frequency spectrum when evaluated through rigorous normalized metrics.

\textbf{Location 8: Retention of Absolute Bandwidth Analysis}

\textit{Important methodological note:} While we have added the comprehensive relative bandwidth analysis ($\eta_{rel}$) as recommended, we have intentionally \textbf{retained the absolute bandwidth (FBGW) analysis and graphical results} presented throughout Section 3, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Figure 11 (0\_disp\_comp\_lattices.pdf): Comparative FBGW evolution across all five lattices showing frequency-dependent performance
    \item Extensive graphical analysis in Sections 3.1--3.2: Individual parametric studies demonstrating how FBGW varies with resonator frequency for each geometry
    \item Performance quantification: Maximum FBGW values (e.g., triangular: 55.40 Hz @ 145 Hz, square: 32.10 Hz @ 105 Hz)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Scientific justification for dual-metric retention:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Practical engineering value:} Absolute bandwidth provides direct frequency-domain insights critical for applications with specific operational ranges (e.g., ``which lattice delivers maximum attenuation at 100 Hz?'')
    \item \textbf{Graphical analysis foundation:} The detailed parametric curves throughout Section 3 rely on absolute bandwidth to demonstrate frequency-dependent optimization behavior
    \item \textbf{Complementary perspectives:} The two metrics address fundamentally different questions‚Äîabsolute answers ``what performance at target frequency?'' while relative answers ``which geometry is intrinsically superior?''
\end{enumerate}

The \textbf{dual-metric framework} thus enriches the manuscript by providing both practical (absolute) and theoretical (normalized) performance assessment tools, rather than replacing one with the other.
\end{changesbox}

\textbf{Note:} This comprehensive implementation of relative bandgap width analysis also directly addresses \textbf{Comment (5)}, as both comments concern the same fundamental methodological issue.

\newpage

\subsection*{Comment (2): Acknowledgment of Xiao et al. [46] Foundational Work}

\begin{reviewerbox}
It should be noted that similar study of the influence of tuning local resonance frequency on the bandgap width has been reported in Ref.[46] for the case of square lattice. It has been revealed in [46] that the widest bandgap occurs when the directional resonance band gap and Bragg band gap are nearly coupled, and an approximate initial design formula has been provided in [46]. The authors should acknowledge existing findings and provide appropriate discussions.
\end{reviewerbox}

\begin{responsebox}
We completely agree with the reviewer that the foundational work of Xiao et al.~[46] should be properly acknowledged for their critical discoveries regarding resonance-Bragg coupling mechanisms. The reviewer is absolutely correct that this seminal work demonstrated:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Optimal coupling condition:} The widest bandgap occurs when directional resonance and Bragg band gaps are nearly coupled
    \item \textbf{Super-wide pseudo-directional gaps:} Formation through combination of resonance and Bragg effects
    \item \textbf{Design methodology:} An approximate initial design formula for achieving optimal coupling conditions
    \item \textbf{Frequency sensitivity:} Dramatic bandwidth changes due to resonant frequency tuning
\end{itemize}

We have revised the manuscript to \textbf{explicitly acknowledge these foundational contributions} through 8 strategic citations that establish how our multi-lattice comparative study builds upon and extends these principles across five different geometric configurations.
\end{responsebox}

\begin{changesbox}
\textbf{Eight strategic additions establishing connections with Xiao et al. [46]:}

\textbf{Location 1: Introduction (Lines 122-123)}

\textit{Expanded acknowledgment of coupling mechanism:}
\begin{quote}
\textcolor{redtext}{``Critically, their work demonstrated that the widest bandgap occurs when the directional resonance band gap and Bragg band gap are nearly coupled, and they provided an approximate initial design formula for achieving such optimal coupling conditions. This coupling mechanism enables the formation of super-wide pseudo-directional gaps through the combination of resonance and Bragg effects, with the bandwidth being dramatically affected by the resonant frequency of local resonators.''}
\end{quote}

\textbf{Location 2: Introduction (Lines 132-133)}

\textit{Connecting foundational role:}
\begin{quote}
\textcolor{redtext}{``Building upon the foundational work of Xiao et al.~[46], who established the critical role of resonator frequency tuning in achieving optimal resonance-Bragg coupling conditions, these studies have revealed critical design parameters for attenuation performance.''}
\end{quote}

\textbf{Location 3: Section 3.1 - Square Lattice Parametric Analysis (Line 450)}

\textit{Confirming frequency tuning dependency:}
\begin{quote}
\textcolor{redtext}{``This resonator frequency tuning behavior confirms the dependency of bandwidth on resonant frequency of local resonators established by Xiao et al.~\cite{Xiao2012}, demonstrating that systematic variation of $f_j$ enables controlled bandgap engineering.''}
\end{quote}

\textbf{Location 4: Section 3.1 - Universal Design Rule (Line 460)}

\textit{Connecting optimal frequency positioning:}
\begin{quote}
\textcolor{redtext}{``The peak position at $f_j = 105$ [Hz] $\approx 0.89 f_B$ reveals a universal design rule for locally resonant metamaterials: optimal performance occurs when the resonator frequency is positioned slightly below the Bragg frequency, maximizing the interaction between local and geometric scattering mechanisms. This finding aligns with the coupling mechanism identified by Xiao et al.~\cite{Xiao2012}, where the widest bandgap emerges from near-coupling between directional resonance and Bragg band gaps, confirming the fundamental importance of resonator frequency tuning for achieving optimal bandgap performance.''}
\end{quote}

\textbf{Location 5: Section 3.1 - Triangular Lattice Performance (Line 555)}

\textit{Extending to geometric variations:}
\begin{quote}
\textcolor{redtext}{``This tuning capability across the full frequency spectrum extends the foundational work of Xiao et al. to geometric variations, demonstrating that while their frequency tuning principles remain valid, geometric symmetry fundamentally alters the bandwidth-frequency relationship beyond what is achievable through resonator optimization alone in square lattices.''}
\end{quote}

\textbf{Location 6: Section 3.1 - Single-Resonator Synthesis (Line 588)}

\textit{Universal relationship validation:}
\begin{quote}
\textcolor{redtext}{``The universal relationship $f_{j,opt} \approx 0.89 f_B$ across different lattice geometries is consistent with the resonance-Bragg coupling principle of Xiao et al.~\cite{Xiao2012}, demonstrating that optimal bandwidth emerges from strategic positioning of resonator frequencies relative to geometric dispersion limits.''}
\end{quote}

\textbf{Location 7: Section 3.2 - Multi-Resonator Systems (Line 624)}

\textit{Extension to coupled oscillators:}
\begin{quote}
\textcolor{redtext}{``The demonstrated tuning capability extends the resonator frequency optimization principles of Xiao et al.~\cite{Xiao2012} from single-resonator to multi-resonator systems, revealing that coupled oscillators introduce new degrees of freedom for bandgap engineering beyond what is achievable through frequency tuning alone.''}
\end{quote}

\textbf{Location 8: Conclusions (Line 1135)}

\textit{Paradigm shift acknowledgment:}
\begin{quote}
\textcolor{redtext}{``Building upon the resonance-Bragg coupling principles established by Xiao et al.~\cite{Xiao2012}, this work demonstrates that optimal bandgap formation requires simultaneous optimization of both resonator frequency tuning and lattice geometry selection. This establishes a paradigm shift from geometry-only to combined geometry-frequency design approaches, with optimal lattice selection dependent on target frequency ranges and application requirements.''}
\end{quote}
\end{changesbox}

\textbf{How our work extends Xiao et al.~[46]:} While Xiao et al. focused on square lattice configurations, our study systematically extends these principles to \textbf{five different lattice geometries} (square, rectangular, triangular, honeycomb, and kagom√©), investigating how geometric symmetry and multi-resonator coupling affect the resonance-Bragg interaction mechanisms. This comparative approach reveals that the optimal coupling conditions identified by Xiao et al. manifest differently across lattice types, with triangular lattices achieving 35\% superior relative bandwidth through enhanced geometric symmetry.

\subsection*{Comment (3): Clarification on Bragg Scattering vs. LRSC Mechanisms}

\begin{reviewerbox}
In the introduction, it is mentioned ``Bragg's condition $a = n\lambda/2$ necessitates large unit cells to attenuate low-frequency waves [30], challenging compact device design, particularly for flexural [31] or elastic waves in complex media [32].'' However, in this study, the widest band gap always occurs in a frequency range where Bragg scattering effect plays an important effect, and the operating half flexural wavelength ($\lambda/2$) is comparable to the lattice constant.
\end{reviewerbox}

\begin{responsebox}
We thank the reviewer for this astute observation that highlights an important clarification needed regarding Bragg scattering effects in our study. The reviewer is correct that Bragg scattering effects are present in our frequency range, and we acknowledge this requires careful explanation of our approach and findings.

\textbf{Key distinction:} The fundamental difference lies in the \textbf{primary mechanism} for bandgap formation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Traditional phononic crystals (PCs):} Rely \textit{exclusively} on Bragg scattering from geometric periodicity, requiring $a \approx \lambda/2$
    \item \textbf{Locally resonant sonic crystals (LRSCs):} Utilize \textit{internal resonances} as the primary mechanism, enabling subwavelength operation where $a \ll \lambda/2$
\end{itemize}

While Bragg effects may \textit{contribute} to the observed band gaps in our study (particularly for square lattices around 120 Hz where resonance-Bragg coupling occurs as identified by Xiao et al.~[46]), the \textbf{primary mechanism is local resonance coupling}, distinguishing our approach from traditional phononic crystals.

\textbf{Critical observation:} Our study prioritizes \textbf{complete bandgaps (FBGW)} that provide omnidirectional wave blocking, which is more valuable for practical vibration isolation than the directional/partial gaps typically produced by Bragg-resonance coupling.
\end{responsebox}

\begin{changesbox}
\textbf{Location: Introduction (Line 110)}

\textit{New clarifying paragraph added:}
\begin{quote}
\textcolor{redtext}{``However, locally resonant sonic crystals (LRSCs) overcome this limitation by utilizing internal resonances rather than pure Bragg scattering, enabling subwavelength operation where resonator-induced band gaps can occur even when $a \ll \lambda/2$. While Bragg effects may contribute to observed band gaps in this study, the primary mechanism is local resonance coupling, distinguishing our approach from traditional phononic crystals that rely exclusively on geometric periodicity.''}
\end{quote}

This addition:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Distinguishes LRSC mechanism (internal resonance) from traditional PC (pure Bragg)
    \item Acknowledges that Bragg effects may contribute to results
    \item Emphasizes local resonance coupling as the dominant mechanism
    \item Maintains scientific accuracy while clarifying the approach
\end{itemize}
\end{changesbox}

\newpage

\subsection*{Comment (4): Extension to Structural Materials}

\begin{reviewerbox}
The attention of this work is place on the low-frequency flexural waves (10-200)[Hz]. However, only one example of very soft thin plate made by soft material (3D printable polymer material) is considered. What will happen for the case of hard metallic material plate, or a thicker plate with much higher bending stiffness?
\end{reviewerbox}

\begin{responsebox}
We thank the reviewer for this important observation regarding material limitations in our study. The reviewer correctly identifies that our analysis focused on a single polymeric material, which limits the generalizability of our findings to broader engineering applications.

\textbf{Strategic rationale for Vero White Plus selection:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Rapid prototyping capability:} 3D printing enables precise fabrication of complex lattice geometries
    \item \textbf{Experimental validation feasibility:} Laboratory fabrication without complex industrial processes
    \item \textbf{Target frequency range:} 10-200 Hz ideal for low-frequency applications
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Major extension implemented:} To address this important limitation, we have implemented \textbf{comprehensive PWE analysis for metallic and composite materials in the new Appendix C}, demonstrating the universality of our methodology across the full spectrum of engineering materials with \textbf{150$\times$ stiffness variation}.
\end{responsebox}

\begin{changesbox}
\textbf{Major addition: New Appendix C - ``Extension to Structural Materials - Multi-Scale Analysis'' (Lines 1516-1650)}

\textbf{Scope note:} To maintain conciseness while directly addressing the reviewer's concern about material generalizability, Appendix C focuses on three core sections that demonstrate universality of geometric principles across vastly different material properties.

\textbf{Section C.1: Material Properties and Scaling Analysis}

\textit{Table: Comparative material properties (Table \ref{tab:material_properties_comparison})}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Vero White Plus:} $E = 0.86$ GPa, $\rho = 600$ kg/m$^3$ (baseline, rapid prototyping)
    \item \textbf{Aluminum 6061:} $E = 70$ GPa, $\rho = 2700$ kg/m$^3$ (from Xiao et al.~2012)
    \item \textbf{Carbon/Epoxy UD:} $E = 135$ GPa, $\rho = 1580$ kg/m$^3$ (from CMH-17 2012)
    \item \textbf{Bending stiffness range:} 150$\times$ variation (0.86 GPa $\to$ 135 GPa)
\end{itemize}

Key insight: This material span encompasses the full range of practical engineering applications from soft polymers to ultra-stiff composites.

\textbf{Section C.2: Frequency Scaling and Operational Ranges}

\textit{Table: Frequency scaling and operational ranges (Table \ref{tab:frequency_scaling})}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Vero White Plus:} 10-200 Hz range, $f_B = 116$ Hz (low-frequency applications)
    \item \textbf{Aluminum 6061:} 200-600 Hz range, $f_B = 484$ Hz (mid-frequency applications)
    \item \textbf{Carbon/Epoxy:} 400-1000 Hz range, $f_B = 879$ Hz (high-frequency applications)
    \item Exact Bragg frequency formula: $f_{B_1} = \frac{1}{2\pi}\left(\frac{\pi}{a}\cos\phi\right)^2 \sqrt{\frac{D}{\rho h}}$
\end{itemize}

Key insight: Frequency scaling follows predictable material-dependent relationship, enabling systematic material selection for target frequency ranges.

\textbf{Section C.3: PWE Analysis Results for Alternative Materials}

\textit{Subsection C.3.1: Aluminum 6061 Analysis (Table \ref{tab:aluminum_results})}

Complete PWE analysis with 12 resonator frequencies (200-1200 Hz) demonstrating:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Triangular:} 222.0 Hz maximum FBGW (42.5\% relative bandwidth) - 1st rank
    \item \textbf{Square:} 131.1 Hz maximum FBGW (31.7\% relative bandwidth) - 2nd rank
    \item \textbf{Performance advantage:} Triangular maintains 69\% superiority over square
    \item \textbf{Hierarchy preserved:} Triangular $>$ Square $>$ Rectangular $>$ Honeycomb $>$ Kagom√©
\end{itemize}

\textit{Subsection C.3.2: Carbon/Epoxy Composite Analysis (Table \ref{tab:carbon_results})}

Complete PWE analysis with 12 resonator frequencies (400-1400 Hz) demonstrating:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Triangular:} 408.1 Hz maximum FBGW (42.2\% relative bandwidth) - 1st rank
    \item \textbf{Square:} 231.8 Hz maximum FBGW (31.5\% relative bandwidth) - 2nd rank
    \item \textbf{Performance advantage:} Triangular maintains 76\% superiority over square
    \item \textbf{Same hierarchy maintained:} Geometric advantages persist across 150$\times$ stiffness variation
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Concluding synthesis paragraph (end of Appendix C):}

A comprehensive synthesis demonstrates that triangular lattices achieve superior relative bandwidth (40-42\%) across all materials spanning 150$\times$ stiffness variation, validating that geometric advantages represent material-independent design principles. The frequency scaling preserves this hierarchy while shifting operational ranges proportionally to material stiffness ($\sqrt{D/\rho h}$), confirming PWE methodology robustness across the entire structural material spectrum studied.

\textbf{Rationale for focused scope:} The three core sections (C.1-C.3) directly and comprehensively address the reviewer's specific concern about material generalizability, demonstrating through rigorous PWE analysis that our findings extend to both ``hard metallic material plate'' (aluminum) and materials with ``much higher bending stiffness'' (carbon/epoxy composite). Additional subsections (design guidelines, universal hierarchy tables) would be redundant with the main text comparative analysis and would unnecessarily extend the appendix length.

\textbf{Additional modifications:}

\textbf{Location 1: Section 3 Introduction (Line 304)}

\textit{Forward reference to multi-material analysis:}
\begin{quote}
\textcolor{redtext}{``While this section focuses on polymeric material for experimental validation feasibility, Appendix C extends the analysis to structural materials (aluminum alloy and carbon/epoxy composite), demonstrating the universality of geometric performance principles across materials with 150$\times$ stiffness variation.''}
\end{quote}

\textbf{Location 2: Paper Structure (Line 142)}

\textit{Updated to mention Appendix C:}
\begin{quote}
\textcolor{redtext}{``Appendix C extends the analysis to metallic and composite materials (aluminum and carbon/epoxy), demonstrating the universality of geometric performance principles across materials with 150$\times$ stiffness variation.''}
\end{quote}
\end{changesbox}

\textbf{Demonstration of universal methodology:} The extended analysis in Appendix C demonstrates that:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Geometric principles are material-independent
    \item Frequency scaling is predictable: $f \propto \sqrt{D/\rho h}$
    \item Design methodology is robust across 150$\times$ stiffness variation
    \item Framework provides material selection guidelines for different frequency ranges
\end{enumerate}

This comprehensive extension fully addresses the reviewer's concern by providing concrete evidence that our polymer-based findings represent \textbf{universal design principles} applicable across the full range of structural materials.

\newpage

\subsection*{Comment (5): Same as Comment (1) - Relative Bandgap Width}

\begin{reviewerbox}
The band gap width used for comparison should be defined by the relative bandgap width $(f_2-f_1)/f_c$.
\end{reviewerbox}

\begin{responsebox}
This comment raises the same fundamental methodological issue as \textbf{Comment (1)} regarding the need for normalized bandwidth comparison.

\textbf{Resolution:} This comment has been completely addressed through the comprehensive implementation of relative bandwidth analysis described in our response to Comment (1), which includes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Introduction of relative bandwidth equation: $\eta_{rel} = (f_2-f_1)/f_c \times 100\%$
    \item Creation of Table 14 with 75 normalized data points (15 frequencies $\times$ 5 lattices)
    \item Reorganization of Section 3.3 with dual-metric framework
    \item Corrections to abstract, conclusions, and highlights
\end{itemize}

Please refer to our detailed response to \textbf{Comment (1)} for the complete description of all modifications and their locations in the manuscript.
\end{responsebox}

\newpage

\subsection*{Comment (6): Justification for Constant Lattice Parameter}

\begin{reviewerbox}
I don't think the lattice parameter $a$ should be kept constant to demonstrate comparison. I think the lattice parameter can be carefully adjusted so that the resulting widest band gap is created at the same beginning frequency for different cases of periodic lattice.
\end{reviewerbox}

\begin{responsebox}
We sincerely thank the reviewer for this thoughtful suggestion, which touches on an important methodological consideration in comparative periodic structure analysis. We completely understand the reviewer's concern about ensuring fair comparison across different lattice geometries, and we appreciate the opportunity to explain our reasoning in greater detail.

After careful consideration, we respectfully believe that maintaining constant lattice parameter $a = 0.10$ m represents the most appropriate approach for our study's objectives. We would like to share the theoretical foundations and practical considerations that guided this methodological choice.

\textbf{Understanding from Bloch-Floquet Theory:}

In periodic structures, we found that the dispersion relation $\omega(\mathbf{k})$ is fundamentally coupled to the lattice constant through the reciprocal space relationship. When we vary the lattice parameter between different geometries, each configuration operates in a different Brillouin zone (with size scaling as $2\pi/a$). This creates a subtle but important theoretical challenge: the dispersion relations would be defined in different reciprocal k-spaces, making direct comparison more complex from a Bloch wave analysis perspective.

We believe this isn't merely a methodological preference, but rather reflects how periodic structure theory naturally frames these comparisons. Maintaining constant $a$ allows all geometries to be compared within a consistent theoretical framework.

\textbf{Guidance from Established Literature:}

In reviewing the foundational literature in this field, we noticed a consistent pattern in how geometric comparisons are performed:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The seminal work by Xiao et al. (2012) \cite{Xiao2012}‚Äîwhich introduced the concept of resonance-Bragg coupling in LRSC plates‚Äîmaintained constant lattice parameter when investigating different configurations. This influential study helped establish methodological standards in our field.

    \item Similarly, in the photonic crystal community, the highly-cited work by Villeneuve \& Pich√© (1992) comparing square and hexagonal lattices employed fixed lattice constants to enable rigorous geometric comparison.
\end{itemize}

These precedents suggest that the constant lattice parameter approach has been well-validated by the research community for fundamental geometric studies.

\textbf{Our Study's Core Objective:}

We designed our investigation to answer a specific engineering question that frequently arises in practical applications: \textit{``Given fixed spatial constraints (which commonly occur in aerospace, automotive, and civil engineering), which lattice geometry provides optimal performance?''}

This question naturally leads to constant $a$ methodology because:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Engineers often face predetermined spatial limitations (e.g., structural bays in aircraft, door panel dimensions in vehicles)
    \item The comparison reveals which geometry makes \textit{intrinsically better use} of available space and materials
    \item Results provide directly actionable design guidelines without requiring additional optimization
\end{itemize}

The reviewer's suggested approach‚Äîadjusting $a$ to align band gap frequencies‚Äîwould answer a different but also valuable question: ``What parameter combinations can achieve target frequencies?'' While this represents an important complementary research direction, we believe it would shift focus from our intended objective of establishing fundamental geometric performance principles.

\textbf{Practical Consideration - Computational Scope:}

We should also mention that implementing the frequency-matched variable-$a$ approach would require substantially expanded computational effort:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Our current approach: 75 PWE simulations (15 frequencies $\times$ 5 lattices)
    \item Frequency-matched approach: Would require iterative trial-and-error parameter search for each lattice-frequency combination, as PWE methods lack inverse solvers
    \item Estimated additional requirement: 400-1,500 simulations to establish matched parameters, plus complete re-meshing for FEM validation
\end{itemize}

While we would certainly be open to exploring this in future work with dedicated computational resources, we believe the current methodology achieves our study's primary objectives effectively.

\textbf{Looking Forward:}

We genuinely appreciate the reviewer raising this important methodological point. We recognize that frequency-matched parameter optimization represents a valuable research direction that could provide complementary insights to our work. We would be happy to acknowledge this as a promising avenue for future investigation in the manuscript.

For the present study's focus on establishing fundamental geometric performance hierarchies under realistic spatial constraints, we believe the constant lattice parameter approach provides the most scientifically rigorous and practically relevant foundation. We hope this explanation clarifies our reasoning, and we remain open to further discussion if the reviewer has additional concerns.

\textit{New justification paragraph added:}
\begin{quote}
\textcolor{redtext}{``This constant-parameter approach isolates purely geometric influences (crystallographic symmetry, unit cell area, resonator coupling) from frequency-dependent scaling effects, providing objective performance hierarchy based on intrinsic geometric properties rather than parameter optimization. This methodology reflects practical engineering constraints where metamaterial devices must fit within predetermined spatial limitations, enabling fair evaluation of which geometry optimizes performance within given space and material constraints‚Äîa critical consideration for applications in aerospace, automotive, and civil engineering where device footprint is often fixed by design requirements.''}
\end{quote}

This addition:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Explains scientific rationale for constant parameter
    \item Connects to practical engineering constraints
    \item Justifies methodology as most appropriate for fundamental comparison
    \item Addresses aerospace/automotive/civil engineering relevance
\end{itemize}
\end{changesbox}

\textbf{Summary:} We hope this detailed explanation helps clarify our methodological choice. We believe our constant lattice parameter approach provides a solid foundation for addressing the practical engineering questions that motivated this study, while remaining consistent with established theoretical frameworks and literature precedents. We genuinely value the reviewer's engagement with this important aspect of our methodology and remain open to further dialogue.

\subsection*{Comment (7): Mathematical Definition of Mass Ratio}

\begin{reviewerbox}
What is the definition of mass ratio in Table 3. What is the meaning of the mass ratio normalized to kagom√© in Table 3. Please provide mathematical formulations.
\end{reviewerbox}

\begin{responsebox}
We thank the reviewer for requesting clarification of the mass ratio definition. The reviewer is absolutely correct that this important parameter requires explicit mathematical formulation for clarity and reproducibility. We have addressed this by adding a comprehensive mathematical definition and physical interpretation immediately following Table 3.
\end{responsebox}

\begin{changesbox}
\textbf{Location: Section 3, After Table 3 (Lines 357-369)}

\textit{New mathematical definition and interpretation added:}

\textbf{Equation:}
\begin{equation}
\textcolor{redtext}{m_{\text{ratio}} = \frac{m_{p,i}}{m_{p,\text{kagom√©}}} = \frac{m_{p,i}}{4.16 \times 10^{-2}}}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Variable definitions:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $m_{p,i}$: plate mass per unit cell for lattice configuration $i$
    \item $m_{p,\text{kagom√©}} = 4.16 \times 10^{-2}$ kg: reference mass (kagom√© lattice with largest unit cell area)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Physical interpretation:}
\begin{quote}
\textcolor{redtext}{``This normalization enables direct material efficiency comparison across different lattice geometries. The mass ratio reveals significant material efficiency differences: triangular lattices achieve superior performance with only 25\% of kagom√©'s material usage, while rectangular lattices utilize merely 14\%, highlighting the geometry-dependent trade-offs between material efficiency and structural performance.''}
\end{quote}

\textbf{Verification examples from Table 3:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Triangular: $1.04 \times 10^{-2} / 4.16 \times 10^{-2} = 0.25$ \checkmark
    \item Square: $1.20 \times 10^{-2} / 4.16 \times 10^{-2} = 0.29$ \checkmark
    \item Honeycomb: $3.12 \times 10^{-2} / 4.16 \times 10^{-2} = 0.75$ \checkmark
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Why kagom√© as reference:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Largest unit cell area: kagom√© has maximum geometric footprint ($S = 3.46 \times 10^{-2}$ m$^2$)
    \item Maximum material usage: correspondingly highest plate mass per unit cell
    \item Normalization baseline: provides upper bound for material efficiency comparison
\end{itemize}
\end{changesbox}

\textbf{Engineering significance:} This normalization enables direct assessment of performance-to-weight ratios and material cost optimization, critical for aerospace and automotive applications where every gram matters for fuel efficiency and payload capacity.
