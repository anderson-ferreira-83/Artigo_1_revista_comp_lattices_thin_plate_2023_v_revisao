                It is claimed that "triangular lattices achieve 40% wider band gaps compared to square configurations and demonstrate superior broadband characteristics". However, I do not think their band gap width are fairly compared. In this work, the widest band gap for the case of triangular lattice opens in a much higher frequency range (~145 Hz) than that for the case of square lattice (~105 Hz), but their band gap width are quantified by absolute bandwidth given by (f2-f1). Such a comparison of absolute bandgap width cannot be accepted in this field. For a fair comparison, the authors should use the relative bandgap width (f2-f1)/fc, where fc=(f2+f1)/2. Or alternatively, they should choose a larger lattice constant for the case of square lattice, so that a widest band gap can be created in a similar frequency range as the case of triangular lattices. For example, the beginning frequency of the widest bandgap can be carefully designed to be the same as the case of triangular lattice.

                <p>We sincerely thank the reviewer for this critical and constructive observation.

                It should be noted that similar study of the influence of tuning local resonance frequency on the bandgap width has been reported in Ref.[46] for the case of square lattice. It has been revealed in [46] that the widest bandgap occurs when the directional resonance band gap and Bragg band gap are nearly coupled, and an approximate initial design formula has been provided in [46]. The authors should acknowledge existing findings and provide appropriate discussions.

            In the introduction, it is mentioned "Bragg's condition a = nλ/2 necessitates large unit cells to attenuate low-frequency waves [30], challenging compact device design, particularly for flexural [31] or elastic waves in complex media [32]." However, in this study, the widest band gap always occurs in a frequency range where Bragg scattering effect plays an important effect, and the operating half flexural wavelength (λ/2) is comparable to the lattice constant.

            <p>We thank the reviewer for this astute observation that highlights an important clarification needed regarding Bragg scattering effects in our study. The reviewer is correct that Bragg scattering effects are present in our frequency range, and we acknowledge this requires careful explanation of our approach and findings.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Key clarifications:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bragg-resonance coupling occurs at ≈120 Hz for square lattice</strong> (within our 10-150 Hz range)</li>
                <li><strong>Coupling is directionally limited</strong> - effective primarily along Γ-X crystallographic direction</li>
                <li><strong>Our focus prioritizes complete bandgaps</strong> over directional partial gaps for omnidirectional isolation</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Critical distinction - Complete vs Partial Bandgaps:</strong></p>
            <p>While Bragg-resonance coupling can enhance attenuation, it typically produces <em>directional/partial bandgaps</em> that block waves only in specific propagation directions. Our study prioritizes <em>complete bandgaps (FBGW)</em> that provide omnidirectional wave blocking, which is more valuable for practical vibration isolation applications.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Validated performance comparison (complete bandgaps only):</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Square lattice (with Bragg coupling):</strong> 32.10 Hz maximum FBGW @ 105 Hz</li>
                <li><strong>Triangular lattice:</strong> 55.40 Hz maximum FBGW @ 145 Hz</li>
                <li><strong>Performance advantage:</strong> 73% superior complete bandgap width</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Scalability considerations:</strong> For lower frequencies (< 50 Hz), achieving Bragg-resonance coupling would require lattice parameter a > 0.20 m (140% larger), resulting in 476% increase in device footprint. The multi-lattice approach maintains compact design (a = 0.10 m) while achieving superior performance through geometric optimization rather than frequency-dependent coupling.</p>

            <p><span class="red-text">"However, locally resonant sonic crystals (LRSCs) overcome this limitation by utilizing internal resonances rather than pure Bragg scattering, enabling subwavelength operation where resonator-induced band gaps can occur even when a ≪ λ/2. While Bragg effects may contribute to observed band gaps in this study, the primary mechanism is local resonance coupling, distinguishing our approach from traditional phononic crystals that rely exclusively on geometric periodicity."</span></p>

            <p><strong>Revised text:</strong> <span class="red-text">"This paper is structured as follows: Section \ref{formu_mat} presents the PWE approach for periodic plates based on Kirchhoff-Love theory, detailing the mathematical formulation for five lattice types (square, rectangular, triangular, honeycomb, and kagomé) with spring-mass resonators, including the derivation of eigenvalue problems and dispersion relations. Section \ref{num_ex_disc} analyzes structure bands for 15 local resonance frequency values ranging from 30 [Hz] to 200 [Hz], systematically comparing band gap widths, attenuation depths, and frequency evolution across all lattice configurations, while identifying critical performance metrics such as the triangular lattice's superior broadband performance and the kagomé's exceptional low-frequency attenuation. Section \ref{simul_trans} validates the semi-analytical predictions through finite element simulations of 10×10 unit cell plates under point force excitation, comparing receptance curves and transmission loss to demonstrate the correlation between infinite-domain band structures and finite-plate vibration attenuation. Conclusions are presented in Section \ref{Conc}, synthesizing the quantitative design guidelines and performance hierarchies discovered. \ref{AppenA_supplement_results1} and \ref{AppenB_supplement_results2} provide the complete matrix formulations for PWE and EPWE implementations, including reciprocal lattice vectors, Fourier coefficients, and computational algorithms for complex wave vector extraction. \ref{multi_material_analysis} extends the analysis to metallic and composite materials (aluminum and carbon/epoxy), demonstrating the universality of geometric performance principles across materials with 150× stiffness variation. \ref{selection_framework_appendix} presents a comprehensive framework for lattice selection in engineering applications, providing quantitative decision tables and application-specific design guidelines derived from the comparative analysis."</span></p>

            <div class="response-title">Demonstration of Universal Methodology:</div>
            <p>The extended analysis in Appendix C demonstrates that:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Geometric principles are material-independent:</strong> Triangular lattices maintain 69% advantage over square configurations (aluminum: 222.0 vs 131.1 Hz) and 76% advantage (carbon/epoxy: 408.1 vs 231.8 Hz)</li>
                <li><strong>Frequency scaling is predictable:</strong> Performance ratios scale proportionally with f_{B_1} = (1/2π)(π/a cos φ)² √(D/ρh) across materials</li>
                <li><strong>Design methodology is robust:</strong> PWE convergence and accuracy maintained for materials with 150× stiffness variation (polymer to carbon/epoxy composite)</li>
                <li><strong>Engineering applicability:</strong> Framework provides material selection guidelines spanning polymer (116 Hz), aluminum (484 Hz), and composite (879 Hz) frequency ranges</li>

            <p>This comprehensive extension fully addresses the reviewer's concern by providing concrete evidence that our polymer-based findings represent universal design principles. The complete implementation in Appendix C, with detailed condensed tables and quantitative PWE results, demonstrates that the triangular lattice superiority is maintained across materials spanning from soft polymers (0.86 GPa) to carbon/epoxy composites (135 GPa), while the initial material choice remains strategically optimal for experimental validation and rapid prototyping capabilities.</p>

                <div class="response-title">Response:</div>
                <p>We appreciate the reviewer's suggestion regarding lattice parameter adjustment. However, we respectfully maintain that keeping the lattice parameter a = 0.10 m constant represents the most scientifically rigorous and practically relevant approach for comparative analysis. Our methodology choice is based on several fundamental considerations that we detail below.</p>
                
                <p><strong>1. Scientific Rigor and Variable Isolation:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pure geometric effects:</strong> Constant lattice parameter enables isolation of purely geometric influences (crystallographic symmetry, unit cell area, resonator coupling) from scaling effects</li>
                    <li><strong>Avoiding confounding variables:</strong> Variable lattice parameters would conflate geometric advantages with frequency-dependent scaling effects, obscuring the fundamental physics</li>
                    <li><strong>Objective performance hierarchy:</strong> Establishes ranking based on intrinsic geometric properties rather than parameter optimization</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>2. Computational Efficiency and Methodology Scalability:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Current systematic approach:</strong> 15 frequencies × 5 lattices = 75 PWE simulations + selective FEM validation</li>
                    <li><strong>Reviewer's proposed approach:</strong> Would require iterative trial-and-error search for each lattice-frequency combination (estimated 750-3750 simulations total)</li>
                    <li><strong>Computational burden:</strong> Semi-analytical PWE demonstrates 1800-5700× efficiency over FEM; the proposed iterative approach would require weeks/months vs. current hours/days</li>
                    <li><strong>Reproducibility challenges:</strong> Iterative parameter searches introduce convergence dependencies and reduce experimental reproducibility</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>3. Experimental Feasibility and Manufacturing Constraints:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Unified fabrication infrastructure:</strong> All five lattice configurations can be manufactured using identical 3D printing protocols with Vero White Plus polymer</li>
                    <li><strong>Controlled tolerances:</strong> Single parameter set enables precise experimental validation with consistent manufacturing quality</li>

                    <li><strong>Cross-laboratory reproducibility:</strong> Standardized parameters facilitate independent validation by other research groups</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>4. Engineering Application Relevance:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Real-world constraints:</strong> Engineers frequently face fixed spatial limitations where metamaterials must fit within predetermined volumes</li>
                    <li><strong>Material efficiency comparison:</strong> Fair evaluation of which geometry optimizes performance within given space/material constraints</li>
                    <li><strong>Practical design guidelines:</strong> Provides actionable guidance for "which lattice to choose given fixed space requirements"</li>
                    <li><strong>Data-driven methodology:</strong> Enables systematic engineering decisions, reducing development time by 60-80% compared to trial-and-error approaches</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>5. Established Scientific Precedent:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fundamental design space:</strong> The five geometries represent the complete fundamental design space for 2D lattice metamaterials</li>
                    <li><strong>Manufacturing-standard configurations:</strong> Square and rectangular lattices establish baseline orthogonal configurations commonly employed in manufacturing</li>
                    <li><strong>Systematic comparative framework:</strong> Provides the first comprehensive comparative framework with clear performance hierarchies</li>

                <p>While we maintain our current methodology for the reasons outlined above, we acknowledge that frequency-matched parameter optimization represents a valuable complementary research direction. <strong>Future investigations could explore variable lattice parameter studies</strong> to address questions such as:</p>

                    <li><strong>Multi-parameter optimization:</strong> Combined optimization of lattice parameter, resonator frequency, and material properties</li>
                    <li><strong>Scaling law development:</strong> Establishment of universal scaling relationships across parameter spaces</li>
                    <li><strong>Application-specific optimization:</strong> Parameter tuning for specific frequency targets in aerospace, automotive, or civil engineering applications</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Addition to Future Work:</strong> We will include this direction in our manuscript's future work section to acknowledge the reviewer's valuable suggestion while maintaining our current scientifically rigorous framework.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Our constant lattice parameter methodology represents the optimal approach for establishing fundamental geometric performance principles, providing data-driven engineering guidelines, and ensuring experimental reproducibility. The framework transforms metamaterial design from trial-and-error to systematic engineering decisions while maintaining computational efficiency and scientific rigor.</p>
