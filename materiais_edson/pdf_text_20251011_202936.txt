fullyaddressedwithsubstantialrevisionstothemanuscript.
Comment(1): FairComparisonofBandgapWidthUsingRelativeBandwidth
ReviewerComment
It is claimed that “triangular lattices achieve 40% wider band gaps compared to square configurations
and demonstrate superior broadband characteristics”. However, I do not think their band gap width are
fairly compared. In this work, the widest band gap for the case of triangular lattice opens in a much
higherfrequencyrange(∼145Hz)thanthatforthecaseofsquarelattice(∼105Hz),buttheirbandgap

Response
We sincerely thank the reviewer for this critical and constructive observation. The reviewer is abso-
lutely correct that comparing absolute bandgap widths (f − f ) across different frequency ranges is
2 1
inappropriateforfairperformanceassessment. Weacknowledgethisfundamentalmethodologicalissue
and have completely revised our comparative analysis to employ relative bandgap width metrics as
recommendedbythemetamaterialcommunity.

• Inappropriateabsolutecomparison: (f −f )inHzunitswithoutnormalization

• Missingcenterfrequencynormalization: f = (f +f )/2

Solution implemented: We have adopted the reviewer’s recommended dual-metric framework that
employsboth:
1. Absolutebandwidth(FBGW):Providespracticalengineeringinsightsforapplicationswithspe-
cificfrequencytargets
2. Relative bandwidth (η ): Enables frequency-independent geometric performance comparison

How our work extends Xiao et al. [46]: While Xiao et al. focused on square lattice configurations,
our study systematically extends these principles to five different lattice geometries (square, rectan-
gular,triangular,honeycomb,andkagomé),investigatinghowgeometricsymmetryandmulti-resonator
coupling affect the resonance-Bragg interaction mechanisms. This comparative approach reveals that
the optimal coupling conditions identified by Xiao et al. manifest differently across lattice types, with
triangularlatticesachieving35%superiorrelativebandwidththroughenhancedgeometricsymmetry.

Comment(3): ClarificationonBraggScatteringvs. LRSCMechanisms
ReviewerComment
Intheintroduction,itismentioned“Bragg’sconditiona = nλ/2necessitateslargeunitcellstoattenuate
low-frequency waves [30], challenging compact device design, particularly for flexural [31] or elastic
wavesincomplexmedia[32].” However,inthisstudy,thewidestbandgapalwaysoccursinafrequency
rangewhereBraggscatteringeffectplaysanimportanteffect,andtheoperatinghalfflexuralwavelength
(λ/2)iscomparabletothelatticeconstant.
Response
We thank the reviewer for this astute observation that highlights an important clarification needed re-
garding Bragg scattering effects in our study. The reviewer is correct that Bragg scattering effects are
present in our frequency range, and we acknowledge this requires careful explanation of our approach
andfindings.
Keydistinction: Thefundamentaldifferenceliesintheprimarymechanismforbandgapformation:
• Traditionalphononiccrystals(PCs): RelyexclusivelyonBraggscatteringfromgeometricperi-
odicity,requiringa ≈ λ/2
• Locallyresonantsoniccrystals(LRSCs): Utilizeinternalresonancesastheprimarymechanism,
enablingsubwavelengthoperationwherea ≪ λ/2
While Bragg effects may contribute to the observed band gaps in our study (particularly for square
latticesaround120Hzwhereresonance-BraggcouplingoccursasidentifiedbyXiaoetal.[46]),thepri-
mary mechanism is local resonance coupling, distinguishing our approach from traditional phononic
crystals.
Criticalobservation: Ourstudyprioritizescompletebandgaps(FBGW)thatprovideomnidirectional
wave blocking, which is more valuable for practical vibration isolation than the directional/partial gaps
typicallyproducedbyBragg-resonancecoupling.

Newclarifyingparagraphadded:
“However, locally resonant sonic crystals (LRSCs) overcome this limitation by utilizing
internal resonances rather than pure Bragg scattering, enabling subwavelength operation
where resonator-induced band gaps can occur even when a ≪ λ/2. While Bragg effects
may contribute to observed band gaps in this study, the primary mechanism is local res-
onance coupling, distinguishing our approach from traditional phononic crystals that rely
exclusivelyongeometricperiodicity.”

Webelievethisisn’tmerelyamethodologicalpreference,butratherreflectshowperiodicstructuretheory
naturallyframesthesecomparisons. Maintainingconstantaallowsallgeometriestobecomparedwithin
aconsistenttheoreticalframework.
GuidancefromEstablishedLiterature:
In reviewing the foundational literature in this field, we noticed a consistent pattern in how geometric
comparisonsareperformed:
• The seminal work by Xiao et al. (2012) [?]—which introduced the concept of resonance-Bragg
couplinginLRSCplates—maintainedconstantlatticeparameterwheninvestigatingdifferentcon-
figurations. Thisinfluentialstudyhelpedestablishmethodologicalstandardsinourfield.
• Similarly,inthephotoniccrystalcommunity,thehighly-citedworkbyVilleneuve&Piché(1992)

metriccomparison.
These precedents suggest that the constant lattice parameter approach has been well-validated by the
researchcommunityforfundamentalgeometricstudies.
OurStudy’sCoreObjective:
Wedesignedourinvestigationtoansweraspecificengineeringquestionthatfrequentlyarisesinpractical
applications: “Givenfixedspatialconstraints(whichcommonlyoccurinaerospace,automotive,andcivil

Thisquestionnaturallyleadstoconstantamethodologybecause:
• Engineersoftenfacepredeterminedspatiallimitations(e.g.,structuralbaysinaircraft,doorpanel

• The comparison reveals which geometry makes intrinsically better use of available space and
materials
• Resultsprovidedirectlyactionabledesignguidelineswithoutrequiringadditionaloptimization
Thereviewer’ssuggestedapproach—adjustingatoalignbandgapfrequencies—wouldansweradiffer-
ent but also valuable question: “What parameter combinations can achieve target frequencies?” While
thisrepresentsanimportantcomplementaryresearchdirection,webelieveitwouldshiftfocusfromour
intendedobjectiveofestablishingfundamentalgeometricperformanceprinciples.
PracticalConsideration-ComputationalScope:
We should also mention that implementing the frequency-matched variable-a approach would require
substantiallyexpandedcomputationaleffort:
• Ourcurrentapproach: 75PWEsimulations(15frequencies×5lattices)
• Frequency-matched approach: Would require iterative trial-and-error parameter search for each
lattice-frequencycombination,asPWEmethodslackinversesolvers
• Estimated additional requirement: 400-1,500 simulations to establish matched parameters, plus
completere-meshingforFEMvalidation
While we would certainly be open to exploring this in future work with dedicated computational re-
sources,webelievethecurrentmethodologyachievesourstudy’sprimaryobjectiveseffectively.
LookingForward:
We genuinely appreciate the reviewer raising this important methodological point. We recognize that
frequency-matched parameter optimization represents a valuable research direction that could provide
complementaryinsightstoourwork. Wewouldbehappytoacknowledgethisasapromisingavenuefor

For the present study’s focus on establishing fundamental geometric performance hierarchies under re-

Comment(10): CondensationofSection3
ReviewerComment
Thepaperisnotconciseenough. Section3canbeshortened.
Response
We thank the reviewer for this suggestion to improve manuscript conciseness. We have systematically
condensed Section 3 through a conservative reduction strategy, achieving approximately 14% reduc-
tionwhilepreservingallessentialscientificcontent.

• Removedverboseexplanationswhilemaintainingtechnicalclarity
Result: Section 3 is now more concise (14% reduction) while preserving 100% of essential scientific
content, validation results, and quantitative findings. All modifications maintain full compatibility with
responsestoComments(1),(2),(6),and(7).
Summary: We implemented a conservative condensation strategy (Etapa 1) that demonstrates clear
efforttoaddressthereviewer’sconcern. The14%reductioneliminatesverbositywithoutcompromising
technical quality. If the reviewer deems additional condensation necessary, we have prepared a second
phase(Etapa2)thatcanachieveupto31%totalreductionwhilemaintainingscientificrigor.
