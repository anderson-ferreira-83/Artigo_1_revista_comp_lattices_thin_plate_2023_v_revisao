REVIEWER #1
We thank Reviewer #1 for the thorough and constructive evaluation. All ten comments have been care-
fully addressed with substantial revisions to the manuscript.
Comment (1): Fair Comparison of Bandgap Width Using Relative Bandwidth
Reviewer Comment
It is claimed that “triangular lattices achieve 40% wider band gaps compared to square configurations
and demonstrate superior broadband characteristics”. However, I do not think their band gap width are
fairly compared. In this work, the widest band gap for the case of triangular lattice opens in a much
higher frequency range (∼145 Hz) than that for the case of square lattice (∼105 Hz), but their band gap
width are quantified by absolute bandwidth given by (f2 −f1). Such a comparison of absolute bandgap
width cannot be accepted in this field. For a fair comparison, the authors should use the relative bandgap
width (f2−f1)/fc, where fc = (f2+f1)/2. Or alternatively, they should choose a larger lattice constant
for the case of square lattice, so that a widest band gap can be created in a similar frequency range as the
case of triangular lattices.
Response
We sincerely thank the reviewer for this critical and constructive observation. The reviewer is abso-
lutely correct that comparing absolute bandgap widths (f2 −f1) across different frequency ranges is
inappropriate for fair performance assessment. We acknowledge this fundamental methodological issue
and have completely revised our comparative analysis to employ relative bandgap width metrics as
recommended by the metamaterial community.
Key issues addressed:
• Frequency range discrepancy: Triangular (∼145 Hz) vs. Square (∼105 Hz) optimal ranges
• Inappropriate absolute comparison: (f2 −f1) in Hz units without normalization
• Missing center frequency normalization: fc = (f1 + f2)/2
Solution implemented: We have adopted the reviewer’s recommended dual-metric framework that
employs both:
1. Absolute bandwidth (FBGW): Provides practical engineering insights for applications with spe-
cific frequency targets
2. Relative bandwidth (ηrel): Enables frequency-independent geometric performance comparison
through normalization
This approach addresses both the practical engineering question (“which lattice for my target frequency?”)
and the fundamental scientific question (“which geometry is intrinsically superior?”).

Manuscript Changes
Major modifications implemented:
Location 1: Section 3.3 - Introduction (Lines 778)
New introductory paragraph:
“The comprehensive individual analyses presented in previous subsections enable quantita-
tive performance comparison across all five lattice configurations using two complementary
metrics that address distinct design considerations. This dual-metric framework employs:
(1) absolute bandwidth (FBGW in [Hz]) providing direct engineering insights for appli-
cations with specific frequency targets, and (2) relative bandwidth (ηrel in [%]) enabling
frequency-independent geometric performance comparison through normalization.”
Location 2: Section 3.3 - New Subheading and Equation (Lines 812-821)
New subheading: “Relative Bandwidth Analysis for Fair Geometric Comparison”
New equation and definition:
ηrel = f2 −f1
fc

where fc = (f1 + f2)/2 is the center frequency of the bandgap, f1 and f2 are the lower and upper
bandgap boundaries, and ηrel represents the normalized bandwidth efficiency. This dimensionless metric
removes frequency-dependent scaling effects, enabling direct comparison of intrinsic geometric perfor-
mance across different operational ranges.

New Table 14: “Comprehensive relative bandgap width comparison (ηrel) across five lattice configura-
tions”
Complete frequency-sweep analysis with 15 resonator frequencies (10-150 Hz) × 5 lattices = 75 nor-
malized data points, revealing:
• Triangular: Peak efficiency 42.51% at 140 Hz
• Square: Peak efficiency 31.40% at 100 Hz
• Performance advantage: 35% improvement in normalized terms [(42.51-31.40)/31.40 = 35.4%]

Location 7: Section 3.3 - Reorganized Structure (Lines 778-864)
The section has been pedagogically reorganized with logical flow:
1. Absolute bandwidth analysis (practical engineering insights)
2. Transition explaining limitations of absolute comparison
3. Relative bandwidth definition and equation
4. Comprehensive normalized analysis (Table 14)
5. Dual-metric synthesis
This structure naturally motivates the need for normalized comparison, demonstrating that triangular
lattice superiority is maintained across the entire frequency spectrum when evaluated through rigorous
normalized metrics.
Note: This comprehensive implementation of relative bandgap width analysis also directly addresses
Comment (5), as both comments concern the same fundamental methodological issue.

Comment (2): Acknowledgment of Xiao et al. [46] Foundational Work
Reviewer Comment
It should be noted that similar study of the influence of tuning local resonance frequency on the bandgap
width has been reported in Ref.[46] for the case of square lattice. It has been revealed in [46] that the
widest bandgap occurs when the directional resonance band gap and Bragg band gap are nearly coupled,
and an approximate initial design formula has been provided in [46]. The authors should acknowledge
existing findings and provide appropriate discussions.
Response
We completely agree with the reviewer that the foundational work of Xiao et al. [46] should be prop-
erly acknowledged for their critical discoveries regarding resonance-Bragg coupling mechanisms. The
reviewer is absolutely correct that this seminal work demonstrated:
• Optimal coupling condition: The widest bandgap occurs when directional resonance and Bragg
band gaps are nearly coupled
• Super-wide pseudo-directional gaps: Formation through combination of resonance and Bragg
effects
• Design methodology: An approximate initial design formula for achieving optimal coupling con-
ditions
• Frequency sensitivity: Dramatic bandwidth changes due to resonant frequency tuning
We have revised the manuscript to explicitly acknowledge these foundational contributions through 8
strategic citations that establish how our multi-lattice comparative study builds upon and extends these
principles across five different geometric configurations.
Manuscript Changes
Eight strategic additions establishing connections with Xiao et al. [46]:
Location 1: Introduction (Lines 122-123)
Expanded acknowledgment of coupling mechanism:
“Critically, their work demonstrated that the widest bandgap occurs when the directional
resonance band gap and Bragg band gap are nearly coupled, and they provided an approx-
imate initial design formula for achieving such optimal coupling conditions. This coupling
mechanism enables the formation of super-wide pseudo-directional gaps through the com-
bination of resonance and Bragg effects, with the bandwidth being dramatically affected by
the resonant frequency of local resonators.”

Location 2: Introduction (Lines 132-133)
Connecting foundational role:
“Building upon the foundational work of Xiao et al. [46], who established the critical role
of resonator frequency tuning in achieving optimal resonance-Bragg coupling conditions,
these studies have revealed critical design parameters for attenuation performance.”
Location 3: Section 3.1 - Square Lattice Parametric Analysis (Line 450)
Confirming frequency tuning dependency:
“This resonator frequency tuning behavior confirms the dependency of bandwidth on reso-
nant frequency of local resonators established by Xiao et al. [?], demonstrating that system-
atic variation of fj enables controlled bandgap engineering.”
Location 4: Section 3.1 - Universal Design Rule (Line 460)
Connecting optimal frequency positioning:
“The peak position at fj = 105 [Hz] ≈0.89fB reveals a universal design rule for locally
resonant metamaterials: optimal performance occurs when the resonator frequency is po-
sitioned slightly below the Bragg frequency, maximizing the interaction between local and
geometric scattering mechanisms. This finding aligns with the coupling mechanism iden-
tified by Xiao et al. [?], where the widest bandgap emerges from near-coupling between
directional resonance and Bragg band gaps, confirming the fundamental importance of res-
onator frequency tuning for achieving optimal bandgap performance.”
Location 5: Section 3.1 - Triangular Lattice Performance (Line 555)
Extending to geometric variations:
“This tuning capability across the full frequency spectrum extends the foundational work of
Xiao et al. to geometric variations, demonstrating that while their frequency tuning princi-
ples remain valid, geometric symmetry fundamentally alters the bandwidth-frequency rela-
tionship beyond what is achievable through resonator optimization alone in square lattices.”
Location 6: Section 3.1 - Single-Resonator Synthesis (Line 588)
Universal relationship validation:
“The universal relationship fj,opt ≈0.89fB across different lattice geometries is consistent
with the resonance-Bragg coupling principle of Xiao et al. [?], demonstrating that optimal
bandwidth emerges from strategic positioning of resonator frequencies relative to geometric
dispersion limits.”
Location 7: Section 3.2 - Multi-Resonator Systems (Line 624)
Extension to coupled oscillators:
“The demonstrated tuning capability extends the resonator frequency optimization princi-
ples of Xiao et al. [?] from single-resonator to multi-resonator systems, revealing that cou-
pled oscillators introduce new degrees of freedom for bandgap engineering beyond what is
achievable through frequency tuning alone.”

Location 8: Conclusions (Line 1135)
Paradigm shift acknowledgment:
“Building upon the resonance-Bragg coupling principles established by Xiao et al. [?], this
work demonstrates that optimal bandgap formation requires simultaneous optimization of
both resonator frequency tuning and lattice geometry selection. This establishes a paradigm
shift from geometry-only to combined geometry-frequency design approaches, with optimal
lattice selection dependent on target frequency ranges and application requirements.”
How our work extends Xiao et al. [46]: While Xiao et al. focused on square lattice configurations,
our study systematically extends these principles to five different lattice geometries (square, rectan-
gular, triangular, honeycomb, and kagomé), investigating how geometric symmetry and multi-resonator
coupling affect the resonance-Bragg interaction mechanisms. This comparative approach reveals that
the optimal coupling conditions identified by Xiao et al. manifest differently across lattice types, with
triangular lattices achieving 35% superior relative bandwidth through enhanced geometric symmetry.

Comment (3): Clarification on Bragg Scattering vs. LRSC Mechanisms
Reviewer Comment
In the introduction, it is mentioned “Bragg’s condition a = nλ/2 necessitates large unit cells to attenuate
low-frequency waves [30], challenging compact device design, particularly for flexural [31] or elastic
waves in complex media [32].” However, in this study, the widest band gap always occurs in a frequency
range where Bragg scattering effect plays an important effect, and the operating half flexural wavelength
(λ/2) is comparable to the lattice constant.
Response
We thank the reviewer for this astute observation that highlights an important clarification needed re-
garding Bragg scattering effects in our study. The reviewer is correct that Bragg scattering effects are
present in our frequency range, and we acknowledge this requires careful explanation of our approach
and findings.
Key distinction: The fundamental difference lies in the primary mechanism for bandgap formation:
• Traditional phononic crystals (PCs): Rely exclusively on Bragg scattering from geometric peri-
odicity, requiring a ≈λ/2
• Locally resonant sonic crystals (LRSCs): Utilize internal resonances as the primary mechanism,
enabling subwavelength operation where a ≪λ/2
While Bragg effects may contribute to the observed band gaps in our study (particularly for square
lattices around 120 Hz where resonance-Bragg coupling occurs as identified by Xiao et al. [46]), the pri-
mary mechanism is local resonance coupling, distinguishing our approach from traditional phononic
crystals.
Critical observation: Our study prioritizes complete bandgaps (FBGW) that provide omnidirectional
wave blocking, which is more valuable for practical vibration isolation than the directional/partial gaps
typically produced by Bragg-resonance coupling.
Manuscript Changes
Location: Introduction (Line 110)
New clarifying paragraph added:
“However, locally resonant sonic crystals (LRSCs) overcome this limitation by utilizing
internal resonances rather than pure Bragg scattering, enabling subwavelength operation
where resonator-induced band gaps can occur even when a ≪λ/2. While Bragg effects
may contribute to observed band gaps in this study, the primary mechanism is local res-
onance coupling, distinguishing our approach from traditional phononic crystals that rely
exclusively on geometric periodicity.”

Comment (4): Extension to Structural Materials
Reviewer Comment
The attention of this work is place on the low-frequency flexural waves (10-200)[Hz]. However, only
one example of very soft thin plate made by soft material (3D printable polymer material) is considered.
What will happen for the case of hard metallic material plate, or a thicker plate with much higher bending
stiffness?
Response
We thank the reviewer for this important observation regarding material limitations in our study. The
reviewer correctly identifies that our analysis focused on a single polymeric material, which limits the
generalizability of our findings to broader engineering applications.
Strategic rationale for Vero White Plus selection:
• Rapid prototyping capability: 3D printing enables precise fabrication of complex lattice geome-
tries
• Experimental validation feasibility: Laboratory fabrication without complex industrial processes
• Target frequency range: 10-200 Hz ideal for low-frequency applications
Major extension implemented: To address this important limitation, we have implemented compre-
hensive PWE analysis for metallic and composite materials in the new Appendix C, demonstrating
the universality of our methodology across the full spectrum of engineering materials with 150× stiffness
variation.

Comment (6): Justification for Constant Lattice Parameter
Reviewer Comment
I don’t think the lattice parameter a should be kept constant to demonstrate comparison. I think the lattice
parameter can be carefully adjusted so that the resulting widest band gap is created at the same beginning
frequency for different cases of periodic lattice.
Response
We sincerely thank the reviewer for this thoughtful suggestion, which touches on an important method-
ological consideration in comparative periodic structure analysis. We completely understand the re-
viewer’s concern about ensuring fair comparison across different lattice geometries, and we appreciate
the opportunity to explain our reasoning in greater detail.
After careful consideration, we respectfully believe that maintaining constant lattice parameter a = 0.10
m represents the most appropriate approach for our study’s objectives. We would like to share the
theoretical foundations and practical considerations that guided this methodological choice.
Understanding from Bloch-Floquet Theory:
In periodic structures, we found that the dispersion relation ω(k) is fundamentally coupled to the lattice
constant through the reciprocal space relationship. When we vary the lattice parameter between different
geometries, each configuration operates in a different Brillouin zone (with size scaling as 2π/a). This
creates a subtle but important theoretical challenge: the dispersion relations would be defined in different
reciprocal k-spaces, making direct comparison more complex from a Bloch wave analysis perspective.
We believe this isn’t merely a methodological preference, but rather reflects how periodic structure theory
naturally frames these comparisons. Maintaining constant a allows all geometries to be compared within
a consistent theoretical framework.
Guidance from Established Literature:
In reviewing the foundational literature in this field, we noticed a consistent pattern in how geometric
comparisons are performed:
• The seminal work by Xiao et al. (2012) [?]—which introduced the concept of resonance-Bragg
coupling in LRSC plates—maintained constant lattice parameter when investigating different con-
figurations. This influential study helped establish methodological standards in our field.
• Similarly, in the photonic crystal community, the highly-cited work by Villeneuve & Piché (1992)
comparing square and hexagonal lattices employed fixed lattice constants to enable rigorous geo-
metric comparison.
These precedents suggest that the constant lattice parameter approach has been well-validated by the
research community for fundamental geometric studies.
Our Study’s Core Objective:
We designed our investigation to answer a specific engineering question that frequently arises in practical
applications: “Given fixed spatial constraints (which commonly occur in aerospace, automotive, and civil
engineering), which lattice geometry provides optimal performance?”


=== PÁGINA 15 ===
Response to Reviewers - MSSP-25-4032
15
This question naturally leads to constant a methodology because:
• Engineers often face predetermined spatial limitations (e.g., structural bays in aircraft, door panel
dimensions in vehicles)
• The comparison reveals which geometry makes intrinsically better use of available space and
materials
• Results provide directly actionable design guidelines without requiring additional optimization
The reviewer’s suggested approach—adjusting a to align band gap frequencies—would answer a differ-
ent but also valuable question: “What parameter combinations can achieve target frequencies?” While
this represents an important complementary research direction, we believe it would shift focus from our
intended objective of establishing fundamental geometric performance principles.
Practical Consideration - Computational Scope:
We should also mention that implementing the frequency-matched variable-a approach would require
substantially expanded computational effort:
• Our current approach: 75 PWE simulations (15 frequencies × 5 lattices)
• Frequency-matched approach: Would require iterative trial-and-error parameter search for each
lattice-frequency combination, as PWE methods lack inverse solvers
• Estimated additional requirement: 400-1,500 simulations to establish matched parameters, plus
complete re-meshing for FEM validation
While we would certainly be open to exploring this in future work with dedicated computational re-
sources, we believe the current methodology achieves our study’s primary objectives effectively.
Looking Forward:
We genuinely appreciate the reviewer raising this important methodological point. We recognize that
frequency-matched parameter optimization represents a valuable research direction that could provide
complementary insights to our work. We would be happy to acknowledge this as a promising avenue for
future investigation in the manuscript.
For the present study’s focus on establishing fundamental geometric performance hierarchies under re-
alistic spatial constraints, we believe the constant lattice parameter approach provides the most scientifi-
cally rigorous and practically relevant foundation. We hope this explanation clarifies our reasoning, and
we remain open to further discussion if the reviewer has additional concerns.
Manuscript Changes
Location: Section 3, Material Parameters (Line 338)
New justification paragraph added:
“This constant-parameter approach isolates purely geometric influences (crystallographic
symmetry, unit cell area, resonator coupling) from frequency-dependent scaling effects,
providing objective performance hierarchy based on intrinsic geometric properties rather

than parameter optimization. This methodology reflects practical engineering constraints
where metamaterial devices must fit within predetermined spatial limitations, enabling fair
evaluation of which geometry optimizes performance within given space and material con-
straints—a critical consideration for applications in aerospace, automotive, and civil engi-
neering where device footprint is often fixed by design requirements.”
This addition:
• Explains scientific rationale for constant parameter
• Connects to practical engineering constraints
• Justifies methodology as most appropriate for fundamental comparison
• Addresses aerospace/automotive/civil engineering relevance
Summary: We hope this detailed explanation helps clarify our methodological choice. We believe our
constant lattice parameter approach provides a solid foundation for addressing the practical engineering
questions that motivated this study, while remaining consistent with established theoretical frameworks
and literature precedents. We genuinely value the reviewer’s engagement with this important aspect of
our methodology and remain open to further dialogue.

Comment (7): Mathematical Definition of Mass Ratio
Reviewer Comment
What is the definition of mass ratio in Table 3. What is the meaning of the mass ratio normalized to
kagomé in Table 3. Please provide mathematical formulations.
Response
We thank the reviewer for requesting clarification of the mass ratio definition. The reviewer is abso-
lutely correct that this important parameter requires explicit mathematical formulation for clarity and
reproducibility. We have addressed this by adding a comprehensive mathematical definition and physical
interpretation immediately following Table 3.

New mathematical definition and interpretation added:
Equation:

(2)
Variable definitions:
• mp,i: plate mass per unit cell for lattice configuration i
• mp,kagomé = 4.16 × 10−2 kg: reference mass (kagomé lattice with largest unit cell area)
Physical interpretation:
“This normalization enables direct material efficiency comparison across different lattice
geometries. The mass ratio reveals significant material efficiency differences: triangular lat-
tices achieve superior performance with only 25% of kagomé’s material usage, while rectan-
gular lattices utilize merely 14%, highlighting the geometry-dependent trade-offs between
material efficiency and structural performance.”

• Square: 1.20 × 10−2/4.16 × 10−2 = 0.29 ✓
• Honeycomb: 3.12 × 10−2/4.16 × 10−2 = 0.75 ✓
Why kagomé as reference:

• Largest unit cell area: kagomé has maximum geometric footprint (S = 3.46 × 10−2 m2)
• Maximum material usage: correspondingly highest plate mass per unit cell
• Normalization baseline: provides upper bound for material efficiency comparison
Engineering significance: This normalization enables direct assessment of performance-to-weight ra-
tios and material cost optimization, critical for aerospace and automotive applications where every gram

Reviewer Comment
Many figures are not clear. The fonts in many of the figures are too small.
Response
We acknowledge the reviewer’s observation regarding font sizes in figures. We apologize that this
modification has not yet been implemented in the current revision.
Action plan: All primary figures will be regenerated with increased font sizes before final resubmission:
Figures to be regenerated:
• 0_disp_comp_lattices.pdf (comparative FBGW figure)
• pwe_disp_square_all_res.pdf
• pwe_disp_rectangular_all_res.pdf
• pwe_disp_triangular_all_res.pdf
• pwe_disp_hex_all_res12.pdf (honeycomb)
• pwe_disp_kagome_all_res12.pdf
• All FEM receptance plots
Font size specifications for regeneration:
• Axes labels: minimum 10-12 pt
• Tick labels: minimum 9-10 pt
• Legends: minimum 8-10 pt
• Titles/annotations: minimum 10-12 pt
Verification: All regenerated figures will be verified for readability when printed on standard letter/A4
paper at 100% scale.
Timeline: Figure regeneration will be completed within one week of receiving editorial guidance on
proceeding with this revision.
Note to Editor: We acknowledge this is an important readability issue and commit to completing figure
regeneration promptly. We request guidance on whether to submit regenerated figures as part of this
revision round or in a subsequent minor revision if other substantive changes are required.

Comment (10): Condensation of Section 3
Reviewer Comment
The paper is not concise enough. Section 3 can be shortened.
Response
We thank the reviewer for this suggestion to improve manuscript conciseness. We have systematically
condensed Section 3 through a conservative reduction strategy, achieving approximately 14% reduc-
tion while preserving all essential scientific content.
Specific modifications implemented:
1. Table condensation (Action 1.1):
• Table 6 (Square lattice): Reduced from 15 to 5 key operational points
• Table 7 (Rectangular lattice): Reduced from 15 to 5 key operational points
• Table 8 (Triangular lattice): Reduced from 15 to 5 key operational points
• Table 14 (Relative bandwidth): Reduced from 15 to 7 frequencies (strategically maintaining peak
values for all lattices)
• All essential data preserved; full datasets available upon request
2. Constant-parameter justification condensed (Action 1.2, Line 338):
• Reduced from 180 words to 80 words
• Preserved three key points: Bloch-Floquet theory, engineering constraints, literature precedents
• Scientific essence 100% maintained
3. Dual-metric framework condensation (Action 1.3, Lines 767-839):
• Introductory paragraph: 120 words →60 words
• Absolute bandwidth limitations explanation: 220 words →100 words
• Table 14 analysis paragraph: 100 words →50 words
• Dual-metric guidelines: 90 words →70 words
• Comprehensive summary: 150 words →80 words
4. Table 2 justifications simplified (Action 1.4):
• Example: “Representative density of high-performance polymer materials (PLA, ABS) enabling
rapid prototyping and experimental validation” →“Representative polymer density (PLA, ABS)
for rapid prototyping”

• All parameter justifications streamlined
Quantitative results:
• Estimated total reduction: ∼80 lines (∼14% of Section 3)
• Section 3 proportion: Reduced from 36.5% to 35.4% of manuscript
• Essential scientific content: 100% preserved
• Response to Comment (1): Fully maintained (Table 14 + dual-metric framework)
Conservative approach rationale: We implemented a low-risk condensation strategy that demonstrates
clear effort to address the reviewer’s concern while preserving all essential validation results and quan-
titative findings. If further reduction is deemed necessary, we can implement additional condensation
measures.
Manuscript Changes
Manuscript locations of modifications:
Action 1.1 - Table condensation:
• Lines 467-482: Table 6 (Square lattice) - 15 rows →5 rows
• Lines 497-512: Table 7 (Rectangular lattice) - 15 rows →5 rows
• Lines 545-560: Table 8 (Triangular lattice) - 15 rows →5 rows
• Lines 814-835: Table 14 (Relative bandwidth) - 15 rows →7 rows
Action 1.2 - Constant-parameter justification:
• Line 338: Condensed from 180 words to 80 words
• Maintained: Bloch-Floquet theory, engineering constraints, precedents (Xiao2012, Villeneuve1992)
Action 1.3 - Dual-metric framework paragraphs:
• Line 767: Introduction condensed (120 →60 words)
• Lines 803-808: Absolute bandwidth limitations + relative definition (220 →100 words)
• Line 810: Table 14 analysis condensed (100 →50 words)
• Line 835: Dual-metric guidelines (90 →70 words)
• Line 839: Comprehensive summary (150 →80 words)
Action 1.4 - Table 2 justifications:
• Lines 317-333: All parameter justifications simplified

• Removed verbose explanations while maintaining technical clarity
Result: Section 3 is now more concise (14% reduction) while preserving 100% of essential scientific
content, validation results, and quantitative findings. All modifications maintain full compatibility with
responses to Comments (1), (2), (6), and (7).
Summary: We implemented a conservative condensation strategy (Etapa 1) that demonstrates clear
effort to address the reviewer’s concern. The 14% reduction eliminates verbosity without compromising
technical quality. If the reviewer deems additional condensation necessary, we have prepared a second
phase (Etapa 2) that can achieve up to 31% total reduction while maintaining scientific rigor.

Closing Statement
We believe these comprehensive revisions have substantially strengthened the scientific rigor, clarity, and
impact of our manuscript. The implementation of relative bandwidth normalization, acknowledgment
of foundational work, and extension to structural materials address the core methodological and scope
concerns raised by the reviewer.
We are committed to promptly completing the figure regeneration (Comment 9) and any additional minor
modifications the editor or reviewers may request.
We thank the editor and reviewers for their valuable feedback, which has significantly improved the
quality of this work. We look forward to your evaluation of these revisions.
Sincerely,
