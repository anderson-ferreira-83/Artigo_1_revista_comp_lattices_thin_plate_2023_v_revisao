\opening{Dear Editor-in-Chief and Editorial Board,}

We are pleased to submit our manuscript entitled \textbf{"First systematic comparative analysis of lattice geometries in locally resonant sonic crystal plates: PWE/EPWE computational framework with finite element validation"} for consideration for publication in \emph{Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing}.

\textbf{Significance and Novelty}

This work presents the \textbf{first systematic comparative analysis} of five distinct lattice geometries (square, rectangular, triangular, honeycomb, and kagomé) in locally resonant sonic crystal (LRSC) plates, addressing a critical knowledge gap in the metamaterials field. Our research introduces several breakthrough contributions:

\textbf{1. Computational Innovation:} We demonstrate a revolutionary \textbf{1800-5700× computational speedup} over conventional finite element methods through our validated PWE/EPWE framework, while maintaining exceptional accuracy within \textbf{0.68\% average error} across all configurations.

\textbf{2. Quantitative Design Framework:} The study establishes the first quantitative performance hierarchy, revealing that triangular lattices achieve \textbf{40\% wider band gaps} than square configurations, while kagomé lattices provide up to \textbf{15 dB enhanced attenuation} through triple-resonator coupling mechanisms.

\textbf{3. Economic Impact:} Our framework addresses low-frequency vibration control challenges that cost the aviation industry approximately \textbf{\$3.2 billion annually}, with potential development time reductions of \textbf{60-80\%} compared to trial-and-error approaches.

\textbf{Technical Excellence}

The manuscript demonstrates exceptional technical rigor through:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Comprehensive validation:} 15-point PWE-FEM comparison across all geometries with statistical error analysis
\item \textbf{Physical insights:} Clear distinction between local resonance and Bragg scattering mechanisms
\item \textbf{Practical relevance:} Bridge between infinite domain theory and finite plate applications
\item \textbf{Engineering tools:} Quantitative decision framework for lattice selection (Appendix A.3)
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.3cm}
\textbf{Perfect Journal Alignment}

This work aligns perfectly with \emph{Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing}'s scope, combining:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Computational mechanics:} Advanced semi-analytical methods with numerical validation
\item \textbf{Signal processing:} Frequency-domain analysis of wave propagation and attenuation
\item \textbf{Practical applications:} Engineering solutions for aerospace, automotive, and civil structures
\item \textbf{Innovation:} Breakthrough computational efficiency with maintained accuracy
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.3cm}
\textbf{Competitive Advantages}

Unlike existing literature focusing on single configurations or qualitative comparisons, our work provides:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Systematic scope:} First comprehensive multi-geometry comparison
\item \textbf{Quantitative metrics:} Performance hierarchies with specific numerical values
\item \textbf{Validated accuracy:} Rigorous PWE-FEM cross-validation
\item \textbf{Economic relevance:} Multi-billion dollar industry impact quantification
\item \textbf{Practical tools:} Ready-to-use engineering design guidelines
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Impact Statement}

This research establishes essential foundations for next-generation lightweight vibration isolation systems. The computational framework enables rapid metamaterial design optimization, while the quantitative performance hierarchy guides engineers toward optimal configurations for specific applications. The demonstrated 2-order magnitude computational efficiency improvement makes large-scale metamaterial analysis practically feasible for the first time.

We believe this work represents a significant advancement in computational metamaterials and will be of great interest to the \emph{Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing} readership, spanning from theoretical researchers to practicing engineers in vibration control applications.
